# Cardiac-Arrest-Prediction

To predict the cardiac arrest, three machine learning predictive models are implemented.
Techniques of machine learning are widely used in clinical diagnosis. The objective of this
project is to develop predictive model based on the various parameter for cardiac arrest prediction
